In the guidelines, the dot always touches the horizontal stroke.

In commercial fonts, the dot does not usually touch the horizontal stroke especially if there is
enough space.

For the Sung typeface, it should not touch if there is enough space.
For the Hei typeface, the dot may be fully joined instead of lightly touching.
