In the reference materials, the third stroke is a horizontal stroke and the last
stroke is a bent stroke with a slanted leftwards stroke (橫撇), i.e. the stroke thins out
near the end.

In commerical fonts, the third stroke is a dot and the last stroke is a bent stroke with a
slanted vertical stroke (橫折), i.e. the stroke does not thin out at the end.

Always use the slanted vertical stroke for aesthetics. A dot can also be used.
