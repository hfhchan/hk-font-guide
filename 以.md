In the reference guide, the left hand component is three strokes, and the dot
is positioned at the top.

In the EDB materials, the left hand component is also strokes, and the dot is
positioned near the bottom, touching the second stroke.

In some commercial fonts, it is three strokes. In some other commercial fonts,
it is two strokes, identical to the GB standards. The dot is positioned
at the top.

Both two stroke and three stroke forms are OK.
