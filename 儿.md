Many characters containing 儿 keep their 儿 shape and do not get converted to 八.

E.g. 俊 should maintain the 允 shape instead of being converted to ⿱厶八.

According to the guidelines, both strokes should be vertically joined to the components
above.

In some commercial fonts, only the stroke on the right hand side is vertically
joined to the component above.

Make sure the component is not changed to 八, and make sure the stroke joining behaviour is consistent.
