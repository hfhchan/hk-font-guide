In the guidelines, the 匕 uses a horizontal line instead of a slanted stroke in many characters.
The hook is also removed in certain cases. E.g. 此, 穎, 熊, 旨.

In commercial fonts, the 匕 component is always a slanted stroke with hook, identical with the
GB-standards.

Always use the 匕 with a slanted stroke and hook.
