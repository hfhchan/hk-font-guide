According to the guidelines, 匚 and 匸 are clearly distinguished.

e.g. All characters with 區 are 匸, all characters with 匱 are 匚.

In commercial fonts, 匚 is sometimes used universally instead, similar to GB standard glyphs.

In some fonts, 匸 is only distinguished by the protrusion on the top; the bottom left is
an angled stroke instead of a bent stroke, similar to 匚.

Depending on the font requirements, either forms can be used as long as it is consistent.
