In the reference guides, 厶 is two strokes. However in the OGCIO reference Sung glyph,
the shape of the first stroke looks like two disjointed strokes instead of being one
smooth stroke.

In commercial fonts, 厶 is drawn as either one smooth stroke, or clearly broken into
three strokes with the starting point of the second stroke clearly shifted leftwards
for balance.

Do not use the reference glyph form where the starting point of the second segment
is too far right and the strokes simply appear to be touching.
