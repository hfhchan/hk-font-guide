In the reference materials, the 捺 stroke of 又 is always joined to the top even when during
avoidance of strokes it is changed to 點.

In commerical fonts it is nearly always joined when the stroke used is 捺 and never joined
when the stroke is changed to 點.

Do not join when the stroke is changed to 點 for legibility.

In the reference materials, the horizontal part of the first stroke is shortened.

In commercial fonts, it is the standard length.

Do not use the shortened stroke for legibility.
