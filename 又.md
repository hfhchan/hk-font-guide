In the reference materials, the horizontal part of the first stroke is shortened.

In commercial fonts, it is the standard length.

Do not use the shortened stroke for legibility.

-----

In the reference materials, the 捺 stroke of 又 is always joined to the top even when during
avoidance of strokes it is changed to 點.

In commerical fonts it is nearly always joined when the stroke used is 捺 and never joined
when the stroke is changed to 點.

Do not join when the stroke is changed to 點 for legibility.
