According to the reference materials, the top component should be a 臼 with the vertical stroke not protruding.

In commercial fonts, the vertical stroke always protrudes and is joined to the bottom 又, and the top component may be 臼 or 𦥑.

Always protrude the vertical stroke and join to the bottom 又 for legibility.
