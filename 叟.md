According to the reference materials, the top component should be a 臼 with the vertical stroke not protruding.

In commercial fonts, the vertical stroke always protrudes and is joined to the bottom 又, and the top component may be 臼 or 𦥑.

I have not seen any commercial fonts which use the non-protruding version, however a quick survey of 6 people carried out on
25 May indicated they wrote the character with 臼 and the vertical stroke not protruding. 🤷

If the stroke is to be protruded, fully join to the top of 又 to increase legibility.
