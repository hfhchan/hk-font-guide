The middle vertical stroke should protrude.

In the OGCIO reference glyphs, the vertical stroke touches the 口 and the two horizontal strokes inside are identical width.

In the EDB reference glyphs, the vertical stroke touches the 口 and the first horizontal stroke inside is shorter.

In commerical fonts, the vertical stroke does not touch the 口, and the first horizontal stroke inside is shorter.
