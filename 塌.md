By character etymology the top right hand side of 塌 should be 冃. However, in the _Guidelines on Character Glyphs_ and _香港小學學習字詞表_ the shape used is 曰.

Most commercial fonts use 日 instead with the strokes inside fully touching as the 羽 component below is much wider and the form using 日 is more legible. This is identical with the standard form used in mainland China.
