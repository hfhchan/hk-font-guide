In Simplified Chinese fonts, the 夕 is often horizontally stretched and
stacked nearly vertically.

This stretched form is rarely used in commercial Traditional Chinese fonts.

Make sure the 夕 in 多 are stacked at least 115 degrees slanted.

The dots touch both sides in the reference documents.

In commercial Song typefaces, the dots do not touch at the end.

In commercial Hei typefaces, the dots either join at both ends, join at the start, or join at the end only.

Do not touch the dots on the end in the Song typeface.

For Hei typeface, a consistent joining style should be used for all dots in 夕,
top left of 祭, top right of 望, etc.
