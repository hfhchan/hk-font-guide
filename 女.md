In the reference materials, the second stroke protrudes the last stroke.

In commercial fonts, the second stroke often does not protrude the last stroke.

Use the non-protruding version for aesthetics.

In the reference materials, the third stroke is a slanted upwards stroke (提)
when 女 is situated on the left.

In commerical fonts, the second and third stroke are joined to become one single stroke,
similar to the old GB standard. This was changed in 通用規範漢字表, where the second stroke
was cleanly separated.

Use the form where the second and third stroke are joined when 女 is situated on the left
for legibility.
