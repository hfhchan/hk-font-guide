Like mainland China, the standard form used to be 强 in traditional moveable type printing,
however the more common form found today is 強.

There are some characters in Unicode where there are separate codepoints assigned for the
characters using these components, e.g. 繈 vs 繦.

However, there are some characters where the same codepoint is used, e.g. 鏹.

Make sure the characters where the same codepoint is shared between the two forms uses
only the form 強.
