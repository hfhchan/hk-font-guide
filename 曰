In the guidelines, a lot of characters e.g. 會、書 use 曰 instead of 日. 曰 and 日 are distinguished by the prescence of the serif in the middle stroke.

In commerical fonts, nearly all of these characters use 日, except for characters using 曰 as the phonetic, e.g. 汩.

Use 日 for legibility except in the case where 曰 is the phonetic.
