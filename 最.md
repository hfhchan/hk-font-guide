According to the guidelines, the top of 最 should be 冃 (without the hook) where the horizontal strokes do not touch each other, like 冒. However, most commerical fonts use the same shape as the standard shape in mainland China, which is also the standard shape used in all other regions except H and T in the ISO 10646 code charts.

The joined shape is better for legibility, especially because the 取 at the bottom is much wider than the component above.
