In the reference documents, 望 uses the slanted form of moon.

In commercial fonts, the slanted form is common, while the non-slanted form of moon is also seen
in some fonts.

The left hand side of 亡 should not change, i.e. it should keep using the bent stroke at the bottom left
instead of changing into a hook stroke.

The bottom uses 𡈼, not 王.

Use the form of 亡 with a bent stroke, slanted form of moon, and 𡈼 on the bottom.
