In the reference Song glyph provided by the Hong Kong government, the right hand side åŒ• does not
join the top horizontal stroke but only touches.

In commerical fonts the stroke is often joined to the top stroke directly, identical to the GB-complaint
Sung glyph.

Both forms are fine. Do not separate the strokes.
