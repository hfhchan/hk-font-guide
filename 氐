In the reference materials, the last stroke of Ê∞ê is a short horizontal line instead of dot.

In commercial fonts, it is either a dot, identical to the GB standards, or a long horizontal line
extending past the left vertical stroke with hook.

Always use a dot or a long horizontal line. Do not use a short horizontal line.
