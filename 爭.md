The standard form used by Hong Kong is 爭, not 争. There are some characters in Unicode
where there are separate codepoints assigned for the characters using these components,
e.g. 掙 vs 挣.

However, there are some characters where the same codepoint is used, e.g. 踭.

Make sure the characters where the same codepoint is shared between the two forms uses
only the form 爭.
