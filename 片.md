In the OGCIO reference glyph, the two vertical strokes of 片 are aligned. The top of first
and second strokes are also aligned.

In commercial fonts, the two vertical strokes are slightly misaligned, identical with the GB
standards. The top of the second stroke is also higher than the top of the first stroke.

Align the top vertical stroke in the center of the horizontal stroke for aesthetics, and keep
the starting position of the second stroke higher than the first stroke.

In the reference materials, the third stroke of 片 is extremely shortened when it is on the left.

In commercial fonts, the length of the horizontal stroke is not shortened, identical with the GB standards.

Do not shorten the length of the third stroke in 片.
