In the OGCIO reference Sung glyph, the inner component of ç“œ does not join the first stroke.
The last stroke is also not joined to the first stroke.

In commericial fonts, the inner component and the last stroke joins to the first stroke.

Always join the inner component and the last stroke to the first stroke for legibility.

------

In the OGCIO reference Sung glyph, the middle component is two strokes, but the first stroke is
drawn as if it were two disjointed strokes merely touching.

In commercial fonts, a smooth stroke is either used, or the stroke is broken into separate strokes.

Use a smooth stroke, or optionally break apart the component into three strokes for better balance.
