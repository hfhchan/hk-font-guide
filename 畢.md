In the reference materials, the vertical stroke downwards is a single stroke, with two ”十“ components
touching the horizontal stroke below.

In commerical fonts, it is common for the two ”十“ components to be fused together horizontally.

In commercial fonts, it is common for the middle component to be joined to both the top and bottom
horizontal stroke, or both separate from the top and bottom stroke.

Note the last horizontal stroke must be shorter than the second last horizontal stroke.
