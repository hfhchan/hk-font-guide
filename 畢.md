In the reference materials, the vertial stroke downwards is a single stroke while the two ”十“ components
are joined to the horizontal stroke below.

In commerical fonts, it is common for the vertical stroke to be broken into two, i.e. the 田 is a separate
component.

In commerical fonts, it is also much more common for the two ”十“ components to also be joined together
horizontally.

The GB-complaint shape joining is fine.

Note the last horizontal stroke must be shorter than the second last horizontal stroke.

i.e. the T column shape in the ISO 10646 code charts is actually the most common form.
