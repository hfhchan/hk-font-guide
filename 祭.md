In the reference documents, the strokes in the top right of чен do not join.

In commerical fonts, the second stroke of the top right of чен is brought upwards above the
horizontal strokes. In some commercial fonts, the first stroke of the top right of чен is
fully joined into the second stroke of the top right of чен, identical with the GB standards.

Use the raised stroke and joined form instead of the lowered stroke and opened form for
legibility.
