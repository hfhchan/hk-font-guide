In the reference documents, 禸 must have the horizontal and vertical stroke overlapping.

Some commercial fonts keep the overlapping while some do not (identical with the GB
standards). The overlapped form is considered more correct.

The component in the middle must be clearly three strokes. Some fonts make the third stroke
completely vertical, especially in characters like 離.

Use the overlapped form for familiarity, and use a vertical stroke to clearly indicate it
is three strokes.
