In the reference documents, ç¦¸ must have the horizontal and vertical stroke overlapping.

Most commercial fonts keep the overlapping, while some do not (identical with the GB
standards). The non-overlapped form is often considered incorrect.

Use the overlapping form.

According to the reference glyphs, the component in the middle is composed of three strokes,
but the first stroke is slanted.

In some commercial fonts, it is rendered as two strokes, same as the GB glyphs. In some
commercial fonts, the third stroke is completely vertical.

All three forms are acceptable.
