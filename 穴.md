In the guidelines, the dot always touches the 冖 component.

In commercial fonts, the dot may be separate from, touches, or fully joined to
the 冖 component, depending on the contour of the stroke and the available space.

-----

When 穴 is used on the top, the last stroke is changed to a bent stroke, e.g. 空.

The bent stroke may be separate from, touches, or fully joined to the 冖 component.
Larger separation or fully joined will enhance legibility.

Do not use a dot.
