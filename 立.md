In the reference guides from OGCIO, the middle strokes touch the top and bottom horizontal strokes.

In commercial Sung typefaces, only the fourth stroke touches the bottom horizontal stroke, identical
to the GB standard.

In commercial Hei typefaces, the third and fourth stroke may be separate from, touching, or fully joined
to the bottom stroke, and may also touch or be fully joined to the top stroke if there is a lack of space.

For Sung typeface, do not touch the third stroke to the bottom horizontal stroke.

For Hei typefaces, keep the touching / joining behaviour of the third and fourth stroke identical and use
a consistent joining behaviour across different components (while considering available space).
