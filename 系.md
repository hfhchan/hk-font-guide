In the reference glyphs, the first stroke of ç³» is parallel to the second stroke.

In commercial fonts, the first stroke is flatter, identical to the GB standard.

The second stroke may be also joined to the first stroke, especially in Hei typeface,
or may be touching, especially in the Sung typeface.

Always use the flatter form for aesthetics. The second stroke can be joined in the
Hei typeface, and can be touching in the Sung typeface.
