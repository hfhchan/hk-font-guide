The standard form uses 㳄, not 次. The bottom left must have three strokes, not two.

There are some characters in Unicode where there are separate codepoints assigned for the characters using these components, e.g. 𦅗 vs 𦆀.

However, there are some characters where the same codepoint is used, e.g. 㵪 檨 䢭.

Make sure the characters where the same codepoint is shared between the two forms uses only the form 㳄.
