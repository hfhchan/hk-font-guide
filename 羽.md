# Hook

According to the reference documents, when 羽 is positioned at the top, the hook is not removed.

In mainstream commerical fonts, the hook is always removed, identical with the GB-complaint forms.

For legibility, the hook should always be removed.

# Touching of inner strokes

According to the reference documents, the 點 and 提 strokes inside 羽 do not touch the 橫折鈎 stroke.

In mainstream commerical Song typefaces, the 點 stroke does not touch the 橫折鈎 stroke, while the 提
stroke touches the 橫折鈎 stroke, identical with the GB-complaint forms.

For legibility, the 點 stroke should never touch and the 提 stroke should always touch in the Song
typeface.

Whether or not they touch in the Hei typeface should be up to the designer, but it should be
consistent across components.
