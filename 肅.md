In the reference materials, there is an extra stroke in the middle of
è‚…, and the bottom left stroke is fully vertical. The bottom middle horizontal stroke
also does not touch the sides.

In commercial fonts, the extra stroke is not present, the bottom left stroke slants
leftwards, and the horizontal stroke in the middle touches both sides, identical to
the GB standards and the reference glyphs in the ISO 10646 code charts belonging to
other regions.

Use the form without the extra stroke, use a slanted stroke for the bottom left stroke,
and join the horizontal stroke to both sides.
