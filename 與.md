In the reference materials produced by OGCIO, there is a hook at the end of the middle component
and it is not joined to the bottom.

However, in the reference materials produced by Education Bureau, there is no hook but it is also
not joined to the bottom.

In commerical fonts, there is no hook and the middle component is joined to the bottom, similar to
the GB-compliant form.

Always join to the bottom for legibility.
