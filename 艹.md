The four stroke 艹 radical is considered canonical by many but the three strokes 艹 radical is most commonly seen in the Sung typeface. Even education textbooks using the Sung typeface will oftne use the three strokes version because the most popular commerical fonts in Hong Kong use that version, as it has higher legibility. However, for the Hei typeface, they use the four stroke version nearly universally.

The two vertical strokes are always completely vertical in commercial fonts. They never slant inwards. The guideline uses a 艹 radical which slants inwards, however this seems to be a misappropriation of the style in the Kai typeface, because other slanted vertical strokes in the Kai typeface do not retain the slanted vertical appearance in the reference Sung typeface.

Note: Characters containing the components 夢、雚 do not use the 艹 radical on the top. Some commerical typefaces use the normal 艹 radical but that is generally considered incorrect.
