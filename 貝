In the guideline documents, the second last stroke touches the bottom of 目.

In commercial fonts, the second last stroke does not touch the bottom of 目.

Do not touch the bottom of 目 for legibility.

(If there is not enough space, e.g. 嬰, both the second last stroke and last
stroke slightly touching the 目 is fine.)
