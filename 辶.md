The character 辶 must have four strokes.

In the reference Song font, the bottom left corner is the starting serif of the
fourth stroke.

In commerically produced fonts, the third stroke is one single stroke that goes
downwards into the bottom left corner, and the fourth stroke starts directly from
the side of the third stroke and do not have a serif.

Source Han Sans originally used the form which is identical to the guidelines, but
was changed to use the serif-less version in version 2.

Use the serif-less version.

Alternatively, use the traditional shape of 辶 which is identical with the
GB-compliant version but with two dots instead of one. Also, make sure the dots fall
at around 45 degree angle where there is sufficient space. The dots being too steep
will look unnatural to people who are accustomed to commerical Traditional Chinese
typefaces.

Do not use the single dot GB-compliant version.
