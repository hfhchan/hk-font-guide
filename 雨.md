In the reference materials, the four strokes inside 雨 point towards each other.

Most commerical fonts use the four strokes angled towards the bottom right (點),
identical with the GB-compliant forms, which are also identical with the representative
glyphs for other regions apart from H/T in the ISO 10646 code charts.

Use the four-點 forms as they are superior in legibility.

When 雨 is used at the top, most commerical fonts change the four strokes into four
horizontal strokes (橫).

To comply with GB standards, in the Sung typeface, there cannot be any serifs. This
does not apply to Hong Kong. Keep the serifs for legibility.
