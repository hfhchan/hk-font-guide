The standard form in Traditional Chinese is 黃 instead of 黄.

There are some characters in Unicode where there are separate codepoints
assigned for the characters using these components, e.g. 橫 vs 横.

However, there are some characters where the same codepoint is used,
e.g. 磺.

Make sure the characters where the same codepoint is shared between the
two forms uses only the form 黃.
