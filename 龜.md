The top part of 龜 must be identical with 兔, i.e. it must start with 𠂊 instead of 丿.

Also the two vertical strokes in the middle must touch upwards. Refer to the H column in
the ISO 10646 code charts.

In the guidelines, the right hand side vertical stroke does not touch the hook stroke on the
left. In the commerial fonts, the vertical stroke always touches the hook stroke.

The right hand side stroke should also touch the bottom for legibility.

For GB-compliant glyphs in the Sung typeface, the components on the left must be clearly
delineated from the left vertical stroke. They are joined in the reference documents and they
are also joined in commerical fonts.

Always join the horizontal strokes in the left components into the left vertical stroke for
legibility.
